### Automatic Git Commit and Push Script

This project automates the process of staging, committing, and pushing changes from a local repository to a remote repository at a specific time each day.🔄

#### Instructions:

1. **Bash Script:** Use the provided `git.sh` script, which contains the necessary Git commands. Make sure it's executable using the command:
   ```bash
   chmod +x git.sh

2. Crontab Setup: Schedule the execution of git.sh using crontab. For example, to run it daily at a specific time, add a cron job by running:
   ```bash
   crontab -e

3. Then, add the following line to the crontab file, adjusting the time as needed:
   ```bash
    0 3 * * * /path/to/git.sh >/dev/null 2>&1

4. This example runs the script at 3:00 AM daily. Replace /path/to/git.sh with the actual path to your script.⏰
   
**Note:**
Ensure that Git is properly configured with the necessary credentials for the remote repository.🔑

Adjust the cron schedule (0 3 * * * in the example) according to your desired time.
